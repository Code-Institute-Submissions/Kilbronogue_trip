            <p>The house named <em>"Gort na Gaoithe"</em> ("Field in the wind") is a lovely house surrounded by the green fields,
            fragrant flowers, trees, rocks and beautiful animals you can find along your walking route. <br>
            Often full of light, the house overlooks the Atlantic ocean and you can never miss the black and white dairy 
            cattle lurking through the house's windows in spring. There is no more than a 20 minute walk until the first pier where you can hop in the ocean which 
            temperature doesn't exceed 18°C in that area. That leaves just the bravest people jump in, without a wetsuit. 
            Sometimes a storm silences the crows for a day or two, but they are often visible on the same spots, 
            at the top of the trees.<br>
            There exists a trail walk that follows a quiet country road with a section on the old 17th century 
            Butter Road stretching from Kilbronogue to near Schull and passing several points of 
            interest with great views of Schull harbour, Long Island and Mount Gabriel.
            The main paths lead to <strong>Ballydehob</strong> to the East, or to <strong>Schull</strong> to the West. 
            There are numerous other paths, so you can easily visit Rossbrin, Mount Gabriel or other nearby beaches. </p>

            <p><strong>Schull</strong> is one of the finest villages in West Cork, an idyllic place to stay or visit along the Wild Atlantic Way, 
            with a tennis, pony trekking, a planetarium, fine restaurants, good accommodation, a boatyard, a weekly country market and a peninsula

        <div class="col-10 west-cork-text">
            <p>There is a story about Irish Great Famine history that should be mentioned and which is strongly related to 
            the parish Priest of Schull - <a href="https://roaringwaterjournal.com/tag/kilbronogue/"><strong> James Barry</strong></a> who lived
            during Famine years.
            Even before the Famine he gave evidence to boards of inquiry  about the conditions in West Cork, 
            pointing out the miserable diet, lack of proper clothing and housing, poor prospects for employment, 
            the uncertainty of a lease being continued, the lack of compensation to tenants when lands were taken
            to build new roads, the desire of many to emigrate... </p>
            
            <p>During the Famine, he and his brother, Father John, also of Schull parish, worked to help establish a so-called 
            <em>soup kitchen</em>.
            They were designed to provide cooked food or soup as a form of relief and it was to be given 
            freely to the people. Soup kitchens were in operation from June to September during the summer of 1847.
            and were to be established in each workhouse district or electoral division. 
            These places fed many people who would otherwise have died, and replaced the hated and ineffective 
            Board of Works schemes that put weak and starving people to hard labour. </p>

            <p>Father James' anger is unconcealed when he describes his visit to the village of <strong>Kilbronogue</strong>
            and finds utterly sad situation there:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p> <em>"Fever consequent upon starvation was spreading among the clusters of cabins… the townland 
                [will] soon be at the immediate disposal of the head landlord, Lord Bandon. There will be no need of 
                extermination or of migration to thin the dense swarm of poor people…; this will take place without his lordship’s
                intervention or agency, I hope, to a better world."</em> </p>
            </blockquote>
                <p>Indeed his words were prophetic – there is no longer a village in Kilbronogue. </p> 
        
            <hr class="separator_1">
            
            <p> In the book <em>"Realities of Irish Life"</em> published 1870., William Stewart Trench
            describes hopelessness and extremely desperate situation in West Cork: </p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p><em>"In travelling through the parishes of East and West Schull, containing the villages of Ballydehob 
                and Schull, and a population of about 16,000 still living, I did not see a child playing in the streets 
                or on the roads ; no children are to be seen outside the doors but a few sick and dying children.</em></p>
                [...]
                <p><em>That bodies are left in the fields for weeks unburied is a matter perfectly certain, and also that 
                they have been left unburied in houses so long that they have been eaten by rats, and indeed so long that 
                they could not be buried, and it became necessary to burn the houses over the bodies.</em></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Extract of a letter from the Anglican archbishop Rev. Richard Chenevix (1807. – 1886.) to the Rev. F. F. Trench 
            mentioning Kilbronogue and the soup kitchen:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p><em>"I have just returned from Kilbronogue. All is progressing there most satisfactorily. Excellent order kept, all 
                your rules observed, and had not this day been rainy, nothing could have been pleasanter than the sight of the 
                200 or more eating their food, certainly with thankfulness to men, I trust also with thankfulness to God. But they 
                did not seem to mind the rain, and we got the children under cover.
                Tomorrow a neighbouring townland, Rossbrin, is to be taken into the system : about a hundred Rossbrinites will be 
                fed by an earlier distribution from the Kilbronogue boiler. They are now dying there, as they did at Kilbronogue 
                before the eating-house was established. I know not what is to be done with Ballydehob; the mass of wild fierce hunger 
                there is almost unmanageable. We shall be spending (and economically and honestly spending) I cannot think much less 
                than 100£ weekly. Some imposture must and will creep in, for everything is obliged to be done in somewhat of a 
                rough manner, but many lives will be saved; and what Dr. Sweetman said tonight: "This is the first efficient plan 
                for feeding the people which has been in the parish" — will, with all drawbacks, remain true. 
                This is a matter to thank God for.</em> </p>
            </blockquote>
