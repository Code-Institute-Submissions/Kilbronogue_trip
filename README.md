## Project Description
***
Kilbronogue trip is the project I took as the first out of four Milestone Projects at The Code Institute 
Full Stack Developer course.
the main requirements were to make a responsive and static website with a minimum
of 3 pages using HTML5 and CSS3, along with any other technologies you would like to use.

The choice of the first milestone's subject took me a lot of time.  I spent hours trying to figure out what 
would make me happy to write about, subject I have enough materials (information and photos) about,
and finally, the overall structure what my project will have in order to represent the best my intentions - to demonstrate
my time in Kilbronogue, in West Cork, where I spent lovely several months of my life during lock-down.




##  UX
***

In this paragraph I'd like to provide insight into my UX process, 
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve 
and how my project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

According to [interaction design page](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design), user 
experience (UX) design is _"the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant 
experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, 
including aspects of branding, design, usability and function."_

I wanted to make my project useful, usable and valuable.
The users I made the website for are people interested in West Cork and its activities. 


### Project Goals

- to create a website that is fully responsive on mobiles, laptops, tablets and desktops,
- to make a page with navigate interface, providing a logical structure easy to follow,
- to get people interested to visit West Cork and to discover surrounding places,
- to learn about these places, their history and history of Ireland in general and to get
my users familiar with it,
- to name the activities I did while staying in Kilbronogue,
- to have all the beautiful pictures I took in Kilbronogue on one web site, easily 
accessible to me, my family and friends and other users interested in subject,


### The business goals of this website is:

- to build touristic awareness of West Cork 

### User Stories

- as a new user, I want to get familiar with possible activities in West Cork during lockdown.
- as a user who likes to travel, I want to get familiar with the Kilbronogue, locate it on the mapand have access 
to accommodation information as well as photos taken there.
- as a user who is on vacation in West Cork, I want to be able to read other people's story who lived there and 
explore the places that are close to me so that I can see as much as possible.
- as a user living in Ireland, I want a destination to visit during the weekend and where to grab a snack and beverage.
- as a user interested in history, I want to learn about Irish history and additonally use the links provided in the page.

### Strategy

The main goal of the website is to attract users interested in West Cork, its history (and history of Ireland)
and mention possible activites a person can do during their stay in Kilbronogue. My personal goal was to 
make a website as a memory of my Kilbronogue trip and have all the pictures I took in one place.
My goal in design was to make everything as structured an intuitive as possible with the interactivity 
of text and images making the UX simple or easy to read.

There is (and will stay) only the English version of the website. Since my website doesn't have particular
social links (Fb, Instagram, Twitter...), the ones provided are linked to  general pages about history of 
Ireland or some particular location in Ireland.

### Scope
I would like to represent myself so that the users can have an idea of the creator of the page.
I'd like to get them familiar with the beauty of Kilbornogue and West Cork, its itineraries and
possible indoor activites they can do if they decide to travel to West Cork. 

### Structure
I started developing my own wireframes using Balsamiq for each page on mobile, tablet and laptop/desktop.

All the pages have a fixed **navbar** with "Kilbronogue trip" logo I created just for the 
purpose of the page.

At the bottom of the page I put a **footer** with social links and copyright included.

* First, _Home_ page has a jumbotron with the quote in it, followed by "About me" section which
is, again, followed by some activites photos with text. 
* Second, _Gallery_ page is a page separated in three divs, each one containing photos
with diefferent subject. _Nature_, _With animals_ and _Food we made_. I colored the last div's
background differently on purpose, just to divide it semantically form first two which both represent
nature. To reduce the width of the page and make it more structured and nicer, and I introduced 
_overflow_ element.
* Third, _Accommodation_ page is the one I introduced _form_ and _map_ section and it's 
the only page that has _table_, so it's a bit more developed. I decided to put more history
related text in this secion which is strongly related to Kilbronogue place and that might
attract people in coming to Ireland and visit West Cork.

### Skeleton
#### Wireframe
[LARGE SIZE wireframe](assets/wireframes/Wireframe-large-screen.html)

[MEDIUM SIZE wireframe](still_in_progress) is still in progress

[EXTRA-SMALL wireframe](still_in_progress) is still in progress


### Surface

I next moved onto the design work of the website.

##### Colour Scheme

I used Google inspect feature to chose to colours that would fit the page and match
mutually. I decided to use mostly greyish and white colours with some dark red and dark blue.

##### Typography


The _Amatic SC, cursive_ font is the main font used throughout the whole website with _Sans Serif_
as the fall-back font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
I used it for navbar, headings, jumbotron and divs which don't contain to much text.
I used the _Roboto_ font for the for the larger group of texts, with _Sans Serif_
as the fall-back.

##### Imagery

I used transition in the first web page, to each activity seciton containing header,
text and image.

I took myself the majority of images. The "norwegian photo I took from [Unsplash site](https://www.lifeinnorway.net/norwegian-mythology-folk-tales/) for the photo of norwegian flag I used in index.html page

I also designed my own logo for the website myself through [The Canva](https://www.canva.com/tools/logo-maker-q1/?utm_source=google_sem&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=REV_UK_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier2_EM&utm_term=REV_UK_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier2_Logo%20Maker_EM&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=Cj0KCQiA48j9BRC-ARIsAMQu3WQ7ydQ2Q3Kda5FdSQv4VHsPLO8MA73UXXeadtTRhM33HDo8yivlf6MaAnemEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)


## Features

The project consists of three different pages, all of which can be accessed through the menu in the navbar.

**Consistent features across all pages:**

-	The fixed navbar containing the menu at the top of the page is consistent and across all pages.
-	The sticky footer is consistent across all pages.
-	The navbar's and the footer's colour is consistent in each page, always containing the same elements.
-	Each page has a footer with copyright information and social media icons linking to diferrent page of the respective media.
-   I introduced "Top up" button which can be find in the right bottom of each page and it
leads to navigation bar which makes the scrolling easier for each user.


### Features left to Implement

In the future, I would like:
* to add the links to the right social networks, because now the pages of the various social networks do not yet exist.
* add more places to visit in West Cork.
* option to choose the language of the website.
