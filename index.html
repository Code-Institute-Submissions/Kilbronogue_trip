                (Irish: <em>Cnoc Osta</em>), 407 m high mountain situated immediately to the north of the town of Schull. <br>

                <p>Real road system didn’t develop until the 18th Century with the building of turnpike highways between major cities. 
                In the 18th Century, Cork became the largest centre for the butter trade in the world and needed transportation corridors 
                to ensure butter could get from remote rural areas to the Butter Exchange (now a museum) in the city. 
                The <a href="https://roaringwaterjournal.com/tag/the-butter-road-between-schull-and-ballydehob/" target="_blank"> <strong> Butter Roads</strong></a> 
                were built from the 1740s on, and provided an efficient and speedy (for the time) route to market. 
                Butter was packed in firkins (40 litre barrels), stacked onto carts, and transported from West Cork and Kerry to Cork City 
                to be loaded onto ships for Australia and America. <br>
                Traces of the old butter roads remain. One stretch runs between Ballydehob and Schull, the one we proudly took.</p>

                So you could imagine how thrilled I was with my first foreing language to be - German. My knowledge of German 
                is lame, but I kind of compensated it with speaking French and Italian. I learned English by watching <em>Cartoon Network :).</em></p>

                also known as the <em>Great Hunger</em> or <em>Great Starvation.</em> <br>
                It was a period of mass starvation and disease in Ireland from 1845 to 1849.
                With the most severely affected areas in the west and south of Ireland, where the Irish language 
                was dominant, the period was contemporaneously known in Irish as <em>An Drochshaol</em>, 
                loosely translated as the <em>"hard times"</em> (or literally, <em>"The Bad Life"</em>). <br>
                The worst year of the period was 1847, known as <strong>Black '47</strong>. 
                During the famine, about one million people died and a million more emigrated,
                causing Ireland's population to fall by between 20% and 25%. <br>
